This page is a work in progress, but we will keep updating it with FAQ's about the show and the games!

***If I am not a "player", can I still participate?***<br/>
Yes! Not only will we be watching the Twitch chat during the game and maybe replying to your comments, but you will be able to join the "audience" of the game on your device and vote on answers and help shape the outcome of the game!

***Is this a one-time event, or a regularly scheduled thing?***<br/>
We stream episodes twice a month, on the second Tuesday of the month (20:00 CET) and the last Tuesday of the month (20:00 US CT). [Sign up for our mailing list](/subscribe) to be notified about upcoming episodes!

***I want to tweet about this! Any suggestions?***<br/>
Please use the hashtag [#devopspartygames](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23devopspartygames) for any tweets, before, or during, a show!

***How can I be a contestant in future episodes?***<br/>

***Will the games be "family friendly?"***<br />
