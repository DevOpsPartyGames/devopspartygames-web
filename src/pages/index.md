      DevOps Party Games takes the idea of "online party games" and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then <a href = "https://twitch.tv/mattstratton">streams it live via Twitch</a> for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts (<a href = "https://twitter.com/mattstratton">Matt Stratton</a> and <a href = "https://twitter.com/IAmJerdog">Jeremy Meiss</a>) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from <i>Dodgeball</i>).

      The goal here is to have fun and not take things too seriously.
      A live streamed game show that is most definitely a ridiculous idea, but hopefully entertaining.
