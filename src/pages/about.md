For those who arenâ€™t familiar, [Jackbox Party Games](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) are a set of quirky, well, party games. They consist of fun takes on Pictionary, Balderdash, Trivial Pursuit, and more. In the world of isolation, Jackbox games have been used via Zoom and other platforms to play with friends and family members around the world.

Irreverent DevOps Party Games takes this idea and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to the Jackbox games [Drawful 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/) and [Quiplash 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash-two-interlashional/), and then streams it live via [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mattstratton) for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts ([Matt Stratton](https://twitter.com/mattstratton) and [Jeremy Meiss](https://twitter.com/IAmJerdog)) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball). The goal here is to have fun and not take things too seriously.
