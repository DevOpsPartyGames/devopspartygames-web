All attendees, players, and hosts of DevOps Party Games are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### The Quick Version

Our show is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any show venue, including Twitch chat, game play, Discord, Twitter, and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Players are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, players should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Players should not use sexualized avatars or usernames, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or banning from the Twitch chat.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

Event staff can be contacted at [devopspartygames@mattstratton.com](mailto:devopspartygames@mattstratton.com). Event staff will be happy to help assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your participation.
