# Overview
For those who aren’t familiar, [Jackbox Party Games](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) are a set of quirky, well, party games. They consist of fun takes on Pictionary, Balderdash, Trivial Pursuit, and more. In the world of isolation, Jackbox games have been used via Zoom and other platforms to play with friends and family members around the world.

DevOps Party Games takes this idea and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to the Jackbox games [Drawful 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/) and [Quiplash 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash-two-interlashional/), and then streams it live via [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mattstratton) for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts ([Matt Stratton](https://twitter.com/mattstratton), [Jeremy Meiss](https://twitter.com/IAmJerdog), and [Dan Maher](https://twitter.com/phrawzty)) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball). The goal here is to have fun and not take things too seriously.

If you’d like to see an example, previous episodes can be viewed at [http://matty.wtf/devops-party-games](http://matty.wtf/devops-party-games).

# The Format
There will be two rounds - one round of Quiplash, and one round of Drawful.

There will be a maximum of 8 contestants, who will play both rounds.

We will be using “custom episodes” of Drawful and Quiplash, where all the prompts will be related to devops/cloud computing/etc. 

So for example, a prompt you might get in Drawful is that you need to draw a picture of “full stack engineer” and the other players have to try to guess that!

## Code of Conduct
All players will need to abide by a [Code of Conduct](https://devopspartygames.com/code-of-conduct). Remember that this will be broadcast live via Twitch, and also will be recorded to be viewed later, so keep that in mind!

Unofficially, the ESRB rating for this will be “M” (Mature, 17+)

That said, please refrain from sexualized jokes/content in gameplay.

## Logistics
All contestants will connect to a private voice room in Discord (your video will be part of the stream; if you would prefer to be “camera off” please just let us know) - please note that you will need to use the Discord app, not just the web interface, for this. The invite to Discord is included in the calendar invitation you should have received. If you need a new one, email games@devopspartygames.com.

Players will see the “screen” of the game via Discord screen sharing. They will use a second device (tablet, smartphone, etc) as the “controller” for the game (the place where they provide input/draw pictures, etc).

The game will be streamed to [Matty’s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/mattstratton/), which is how the “audience” can watch. The Twitch channel will display the main screen of the game, plus indicators of who is in the Discord room and when they are speaking. All audio from the game (plus the Discord call) will also be streamed to Twitch, so that contestants will be able to be heard.

Please note: your camera **will** be on for the stream, so be “camera ready” (whatever that means to you!). If you would prefer to NOT have your camera show in the stream, please let Matty know.

People watching the game can join the “audience” of the game on their personal devices; this lets them vote/participate in the rankings for the game as well! The audience doesn’t “play the game” but they vote on the players’ responses and can potentially influence the winners!

There will be 6-8 players, who will play both rounds. The hosts (Matty, Jeremy, Dan) will not be playing (it would be slightly unfair since we wrote the prompts!)

## Discord
If you are not already in our Discord server, please join with the invite link at [https://devopspartygames.com/discord](https://devopspartygames.com/discord). You will need to accept the Code of Conduct to get access to the server. **Please let an admin know when you have joined, and we will grant you the “Players” role that gives you more access in Discord.** We will be capturing/streaming the audio from the Discord chat to the livestream. Also, bear in mind that your Discord username and avatar will be displayed on the stream (it will “light up” when you are speaking; see the screenshot below for an example)

![](/images/discord-overlay-example.jpg)

Once you join Discord, send a note anyone listed under Admins in the Discord (Matty, Jeremy, or Dan) and let us know you are in; we will grant you the proper role to give you access to the “Game” voice channel (and the “players” text channel). The “Game” voice channel is what you will need to join/connect audio to during the actual stream/event. The text channel is just in case we want it. 

You also should set your “nickname” on our Discord server to your actual name - that is what will display in the overlay instead of your Discord username. It will just look nicer :)

Note that the Discord is public for members of the community; there are private channels just for players and moderators though!

## Schedule
Episodes are streamed at **20:00 UTC+1** (EMEA league) or **20:00 UTC-6** (Americas league) on a **Tuesday**!  The game itself (all rounds) will likely take about an hour, but we will schedule an extra 30 minutes prior for “green room” time to make sure everything is working as expected. Please join the Discord voice channel (“Game”) **30 minutes before show time on game night** so we can do tech checks, etc.

You will receive a calendar invite for the game, which is the time you should join the "Game" channel in Discord and be ready to go.

We will also provide the ability for a “practice” session (optional) which will be “classic” Drawful and Quiplash, which could be helpful for players who are new to these games. You will get a calendar invite for this practice game; it’s totally optional, but join if you want! It should be fun.

Here is a rough schedule (all times are the time zone of the game)

19:30: Players join Discord and do audio checks/tech checks, etc<br />
19:50: Stream on twitch.tv/mattstratton starts with countdown to show timer<br />
20:00: Show starts streaming live, audio from players is “hot”, etc. Hosts introduce the game and introduce the players<br />
20:05: Start playing first game<br />
20:30: Start playing second game<br />
20:55: End of show; thank everyone for playing/watching, etc. 

Note that these times are estimated; we aren’t 100% sure how long each round will take, etc, so it’s POSSIBLE the show might go a few minutes over.
