# Overview
For those who aren’t familiar, [Jackbox Party Games](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) are a set of quirky, well, party games. They consist of fun takes on Pictionary, Balderdash, Trivial Pursuit, and more. In the world of isolation, Jackbox games have been used via Zoom and other platforms to play with friends and family members around the world.

DevOps Party Games takes this idea and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to the Jackbox games [Drawful 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/) and [Quiplash 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash-two-interlashional/), and then streams it live via [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/devopspartygames) for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts ([Matt Stratton](https://twitter.com/mattstratton), [Jeremy Meiss](https://twitter.com/IAmJerdog), and [Dan Maher](https://twitter.com/phrawzty)) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball). The goal here is to have fun and not take things too seriously.

If you’d like to see an example, previous episodes can be viewed at [http://matty.wtf/devops-party-games](http://matty.wtf/devops-party-games).

# The Format
There are three rounds: one each of Quiplash, Thriplash (a variant of Quiplash), and Drawful.

There will be a maximum of 8 contestants, who will play both rounds.

We will be using “custom episodes” of Drawful and Quiplash, where all the prompts will be related to devops/cloud computing/etc. 

So for example, a prompt you might get in Drawful is that you need to draw a picture of “full stack engineer” and the other players have to try to guess that!

## Code of Conduct
All players must abide by a [Code of Conduct](https://devopspartygames.com/code-of-conduct). Remember that this will be both broadcast live via Twitch and recorded for Youtube—so keep that in mind!

Unofficially, our ESRB rating is “M” (Mature, 17+).

That said, please refrain from sexualized jokes/content in gameplay.

## Logistics
All contestants and hosts will connect to Zoom video call (the Zoom link will be in your calendar invite). Your video will be part of the stream—if you would prefer to be “camera off” please just let us know.

Players will see the “screen” of the game via Zoom screen sharing. They will use a second device (tablet, smartphone, etc) as the “controller” for the game (the place where they provide input/draw pictures, etc). Players with multiple displays (or one _really big_ one) can use the same device for both. Keep in mind that games that require drawing (i.e., Drawful) can be a little more challenging when using a mouse or trackpad!

The game will be streamed to [Matty’s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/devopspartygames/), which is how the audience watches and participates (more on that later). The Twitch channel displays the main screen of the game, plus the cameras of all players and hosts. All audio from the game (plus the Zoom call) is also streamed to Twitch, and audience interaction is encouraged!

The audience can join the game on their personal devices. While they don't play the games directly, they can vote on answers, and this can have a big impact on scoring. (Yes, pandering to the audience is absolutely a valid strategy.)

There will be 6–8 players, who will play both rounds. The hosts don't play (it would be slightly unfair since we know the prompts ahead of time).

## Discord
If you are not already in our Discord server, please join with the invite link at [https://devopspartygames.com/discord](https://devopspartygames.com/discord). You will need to accept the Code of Conduct to get access to the server. **Please let an admin know when you have joined, and we will grant you the “Players” role that gives you more access in Discord.** We will use Discord for coordination and chatting amongst each other prior to the game, etc.

Note that the Discord is public for members of the community; there are private channels just for players and moderators though!

## Schedule
Episodes are generally streamed at **20:00 CET / Paris** (EMEA league) or **20:00 CT / Chicago** (Americas league) on a **Tuesday**. The game itself (all rounds) takes about an hour, but we schedule an extra 30 minutes prior for “green room” time to make sure everything is working as expected. Please join the Zoom call **30 minutes before show time on game night** so we can do tech checks, etc.

You will receive a calendar invite for the game, which will have all the salient details you'll need to connect.

We will also provide the ability for a “practice” session (optional) which will be “classic” Drawful and Quiplash, which could be helpful for players who are new to these games. You will get a calendar invite for this practice game; it’s totally optional, but join if you want! It should be fun.

Here's the rough schedule:

19:30: Players join Discord and do audio checks/tech checks, etc.<br />
19:50: Stream on twitch.tv/devopspartygames starts with “countdown to show” timer<br />
20:00: Show starts streaming live, audio from players is “hot”, etc. Hosts introduce the game and introduce the players<br />
20:05: Start playing first game<br />
20:30: Start playing second game<br />
20:55: End of show; thank everyone for playing/watching, etc. 

Note that these times are estimated; we aren’t 100% sure how long each round will take, etc, so it’s POSSIBLE the show might go a few minutes over.

## FAQ

**EMEA League** Episodes usually start at 20:00 CET / Paris on the second Tuesday of each month.<br />

It’s like a party game, but on the internet, and all you need to bring is yourself and your sense of humor!
